# Anemia_Predection_by_CBC

## Anemia Detection
This project focuses on using simple deep learning algorithm for the detection of anemia through the analysis of a Full Blood Count (CBC). Anemia is a significant medical condition characterized by a low red blood cell count or diminished hemoglobin levels, or a combination of both. Hemoglobin, a vital protein responsible for transporting oxygen to every cell in the body through the bloodstream, plays a crucial role in overall health. Anemia can manifest with symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, pallor, and shortness of breath.

Various factors contribute to the onset of anemia, including deficiencies in Vitamin K/B12, medical treatments like chemotherapy, and genetic predispositions. The project aims to predict the presence of anemia by thoroughly evaluating CBC data, employing simple machine learning techniques.

## 1. Introduction

It is possible to predict anemia by a CBC-Complete Blood count (aka Full blood count). Here, the following parameters have been used.
* Haemoglobin concentration (The amount of Haemoglobin in blood) - Normaly 14 g/dL
* Mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) average amount of haemoglobin in each red blood cell. (Normaly 30pg)
* Mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) Normaly 32g/dL
* Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) noramaly 100g/dL

for the deep learning, Tensor flow has been used.
